## Inspiration
We wanted to create a multi-functional mobile app that empowers people, especially those of targeted demographics, to stand up against police brutality and injustice.

## What it does
* Informs users on their rights based on their individual situations
* Provides a guideline on the pieces of information that should be collected in a police encounter
* Sends an auto-generated text message with location data to an emergency contact in the case of an arrest
* Guides the user to create a police complaint letter through an auto-generated template

## How We built it
* Firebase and Flutter

## Challenges We ran into
* Delegating tasks in a team
* Working with different environments and getting all of our apps to sync
* Developing features that are practical and usable to people facing police brutality
* Trying to understand the challenges that other POC encounter
* Marketing our app and the best way to present our ideas

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
* Learning mobile development on Flutter
* Learning about how to create a marketing pitch

## What I learned
* The reality of racial injustice
* Individual rights
* Different situations in which police aggression and injustice may occur

## What's next for Defenderr
* Supporting photo documentation in creating police reports
* Voice-activated functions, for situations when users are not able to access their phones easily
* Voice to text transcription
* Release for IOS
